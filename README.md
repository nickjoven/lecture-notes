*"What does the average day look like for a working software engineer?"*

## Disclaimer

Information below is based on *moderately-sized, moderately-organized* companies.

<br />

### Sprints

A sprint is a 1-2 week period in which features are planned for, developed, deployed, and reviewed. The company has a codebase. You are getting hired to contribute to the codebase.

Full Sprint Cycle:

- Plan
- Design
- Develop
- Test
- Deploy
- Review
- Launch

<br />

### Project Boards and Tickets

Eamples: Asana, Trello, GitHub Issues, Jira

Active Sprints will be divided into *tickets* that fall into progress categories.

Category Examples: To Do, In Progress, Code Review, Done

Tickets will have a number or other indicator that denotes the difficulty or complexity of the ticket.

You may be assigned tickets, but after a number of sprints, you are expected to pick your own tickets. (Company dependent)

<br />

### Typical Workday

- 9:00am - Standup
- 9:30am - Working a ticket/selecting a ticket/pair progamming

- 1:00pm - Check-in (about 15 minutes)
- 1:15pm - Documentation reading & referencing
- 1:30pm - Codebase reading
- 2:00pm - Resume work on a ticket
- 3:30pm - Testing ticket "In Review" (code review)
- 4:00pm - Merge PR
- 4:00 - EOD - Helping pair, grab new ticket, catch up on slack

Retro - Reflecting on what went wrong, what went well, and what actions to improve on the next sprint

### Coding vs. Software Engineering

Software engineering is understanding concepts and principles, and when to apply them.

Such as... 
- Lazy loading
- Eager loading
- Principle of least privilege
- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility
- Time & Space complexity (Big O Notation)

<br />

## How to get where you're going

Think about the core technologies needed for your role (front end, back end, full stack) and the subtopics related to those. (see roadmaps)

<br />

### Interviewing

Process: 
- Phone Call
- Assessment
- Interview
- Hired! (perhaps)

#### Tips

Add GlossaryTech to Chrome. Run this extension while looking at a job listing and familiarize yourself with the jargon.

Concern yourself with the technologies required for a position. Say yes to everything else. Team player? OF COURSE. Care about the company's vision. ABSOLUTELY.

### What About the LAYOFFS?

Companies are still hiring. Head counts have been under scrutiny for some time. But, there have always been companies in need of developers, and they're still there.

### LinkedIn

"Do not be yourself. Be a version of yourself."

Don't go on LinkedIn and be yourself. The platform is not for being genuine, it is for networking. Be a corporate shell as much as you can. *Get in touch with your corporate marketing side*

### Breaking Into the Field

**Do something that allows you to work on hard skills, soft skills, and networking all at the same time. Thee birds, one stone:**

Develop Software. Develop Software. Develop Software that will actually be used. Learn about user experience and user interface design by having people use your software. Network by interacting with people who have seen your application.

### LeetCode

You don't necessarily need LeetCode; your job won't rely on using LeetCode and not every interview will have a DSA portion.
